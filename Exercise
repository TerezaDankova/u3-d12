Jobs Search Engine
You are in charge of improving an existing project, a search engine for remote job offerings.

➡️ Today you’re going to finish the project implementing loading indicators, handling errors and adding redux-persist.

 

TASKS: (start from yesterday’s work)
Insert new actions and reducer cases for handling loading processes and errors like we did in lecture. Attach to those properties spinners and error messages in the affected components.
Install the redux-persist package from npm (npm i redux-persist) and add it to your project. The goal is to make your Redux store survive a browser refresh.
Keep intact the rest of the functionalities.
[EXTRA]

encrypt your storage engine with AES using redux-persist-transform-encrypt, and save the key into a .env file.
